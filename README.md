# Inspiration
Late January 2021, the stock price of GameStop (NYSE: GME) soared up by 1500% in two weeks, squeezing out several famous short selling hedge funds. How did this frenzy happen? Turns out it was backed up by retail investors, many of whom are subscribers of the red-hot subReddit "wallstreetbets". While it is shocking that Internet memes and seemingly-immature retail investors could make such a huge impact, GME was not the only stock they were after. Later in the year, stocks like AMC and BlackBerry were sent to the moon as well. My inspiration of building this app was to provide an easy way to track the most discussed stocks in [/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) on a daily basis, so that interested investors may have a chance to find the next GME before everybody else.

# What it does
Provides the names of the 10 most discussed stocks based on the title and contents of the posts in /WallStreetBets, on a daily basis. The app also provides the relevant financial information of these stocks (e.g., industry, previous day closing price, 50-day average price, etc.).
